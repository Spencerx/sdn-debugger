This is a troubleshooting framework for software-defined networks. It is
useful for both network operators seeking to track down network policy-violations,
and platform developers seeking to test and debug control software.

The code is quite nascent and still in flux.

 == Notes ==

Requires python 2.7+

You'll need to link in the current 'debugger' branch of pox to run the debugger --
it is used as an infrastructure framework.

Typical workflow:
~/debugger $ cd ..
~ $ git clone git://github.com/noxrepo/pox.git pox/
~ $ cd debugger
~/debugger $ ln -s ../pox pox

To run, see:
  $ ./debugger.py -h
